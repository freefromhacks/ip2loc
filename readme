A wee bit o' code looking at Ruby, Perl, and Python grabbing a XML file from a

It's supposed to display your location based on information related to your IP
number, but there are areas where inaccurate information leads the results
astray. Your mileage might vary. There is no guarantee this works, or doesn't
work, so use it at your own risk.
